## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }


ipond_active_fork_enrichment_1 <- read_excel("ipond active fork enrichment 1.xlsx")
View(ipond_active_fork_enrichment_1)
```


```{r}
# Reorder term description based on observed gene count in ascending order
ipond_active_fork_enrichment_1$`term description` <- forcats::fct_reorder(ipond_active_fork_enrichment_1$`term description`, 
                                                                          ipond_active_fork_enrichment_1$`observed gene count`)




ggplot(ipond_active_fork_enrichment_1, aes(x = `observed gene count`, y = `term description`)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = strength, color = -log10(`false discovery rate`))) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(10, 400, by = 10), limits = c(10, 400)) +
  labs(color = expression(-log[10](FDR)), size = "strength", 
       x = "Observed Gene Count", y = "Pathway", 
       title = "Top 10 Enriched Gene Pathway in Active Fork") +
  theme_bw()



```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}


ipond_active_fork_enrichment_1$`term description` <- forcats::fct_reorder(ipond_active_fork_enrichment_1$`term description`, 
                                                                          ipond_active_fork_enrichment_1$`observed gene count`)





kuaile<- ggplot(ipond_active_fork_enrichment_1, aes(x = `observed gene count`, y = `term description`)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = 0, yend = `term description`), color = "grey") +

          geom_vline(xintercept = 20, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey", alpha = 0.5) +
            geom_vline(xintercept = 60, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey", alpha = 0.5) +
              geom_vline(xintercept = 40, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey", alpha = 0.5) +
              




               
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(aes(size = strength, color = -log10(`false discovery rate`))) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 60, by = 20), limits = c(0, 60)) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(4, 8)) +  # Adjust the range of size values if needed
  labs(color = expression(-log[10](FDR)), size = "Strength", 
       x = "Observed Gene Count", y = "Pathwaies", 
       title = "Decreased Biological Processes in TRINSIC at 24h") +
  theme_bw()+
  theme(
          
        panel.grid = element_blank())

print(kuaile)

ggsave( "lollipop plot Decreased Biological Processes in TRINSIC at 24hs .tiff", plot = kuaile, width = 9, height =8, dpi = 600)
```

ggsave( "lollipop plot for pclip vs TRINSIC increase 0.58 Biological Processes .tiff", plot = kuaile, width = 9, height =8, dpi = 600)
```

ggsave( "lollipop plot for pclip vs Thymidine increase 0.58 Molecular Functions .tiff", plot = kuaile, width = 9, height =8, dpi = 600)

ggsave( "Decreased Biological Processes in Nucleoplasm .tiff", plot = kuaile, width = 9, height =8, dpi = 600)


```

ggsave( "lollipop plot for pclip vs Thymidine increase 0.58  Biological Processes .tiff", plot = kuaile, width = 9, height =8, dpi = 600)

ggsave( "lollipop plot for pclip vs Thymidine increase 0.58 Molecular Function .tiff", plot = kuaile, width = 9, height =8, dpi = 600)


ggsave( "lollipop plot for pclip vs Trinsic decrease 0.58 48h .tiff", plot = kuaile, width = 9, height =8, dpi = 1800)



ggsave( "lollipop plot for pclip vs thymidine increase 0.58 .tiff", plot = kuaile, width = 9, height =8, dpi = 1800)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
